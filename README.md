# DEPI-Graduation-Project

📁 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, forecasting, and visualizing employee data to support data-driven decisions in HR. It includes extensive preprocessing in Python and interactive dashboards built in Tableau.


🔧 Data Preprocessing (Python)

Initial State: No missing values or duplicated entries.

Issues Found:

Incorrect data types.

Outliers affecting numerical fields.

Actions Taken :

Converted numerical columns into categorical labels (e.g., salary bands, satisfaction levels).

Removed or handled outliers where necessary.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed through Python to answer key HR-related questions, such as :

What factors contribute most to employee attrition?

Is there a relationship between salary and job satisfaction ?

What departments have the highest turnover?


📈 Forecasting

Used time-series forecasting methods to predict future employee attrition and hiring trends.


📉 Dashboards (Tableau)

Created 4 interactive dashboards to visualize :

Salary Analysis – Distribution and trends across departments.

Employee Attrition – Patterns by age, job role, satisfaction, etc.

Employee Demographics – General employee statistics.

Satisfaction & Promotion – Insights into employee happiness and career growth.
