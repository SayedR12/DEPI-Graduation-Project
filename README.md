# DEPI-Graduation-Project

📁 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, forecasting, and visualizing employee data to support data-
driven decisions in HR. It includes extensive preprocessing in Python and interactive dashboards built in Tableau.


🔧 Data Preprocessing (Python)
Initial State: No missing values or duplicated entries.

Issues Found:
Incorrect data types.
Outliers affecting numerical fields.

Actions Taken :
Converted numerical columns into categorical labels (e.g., salary bands, satisfaction levels).
Removed or handled outliers where necessary.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed through Python to answer key HR-related questions, such as :

What factors contribute most to employee attrition?
Is there a relationship between salary and job satisfaction ?
What departments have the highest turnover?


📈 Forecasting
Used time-series forecasting methods to predict future employee attrition and hiring trends.

📉 Dashboards (Tableau)
Created 4 interactive dashboards to visualize :
Salary Analysis – Distribution and trends across departments.
Employee Attrition – Patterns by age, job role, satisfaction, etc.
Employee Demographics – General employee statistics.
Satisfaction & Promotion – Insights into employee happiness and career growth.
